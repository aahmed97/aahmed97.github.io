            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a third year undergraduate student at the University of Alberta pursuing a 
                degree in Computing Science with a specialization in Software. Prior to this, I completed two years of the 
                Biological Sciences Program at the University of Calgary. At the University of Calgary I took my first 
                introductory course in computing and was completely enthralled by the process involved in the creation of software.
                I yearned to create software that creates a positive impact on society by improving the lives of the individual which
                is why I decided to make the change in my academic career in order to bring me that much closer to achieving my goal. <br><br> 

                In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, going on walks, and occasionally playing video games 
                with my younger brother. Hopefully, in the future I get a chance to travel once in a while to enjoy what the world has to offer.
                For this reason, I am completely open to relocating for an internship or work opportunity in order to both do what I love at work
                and to also get a chance to experience a new location.
                <br><br>

                I am currently seeking a 4 or 8 month internship to make valuable contributions to 
                software projects as well as use the opportunity to further grow my skillset.

                    <p>
                        Written in C, this project simulates a linear SDN where clients can communicate 
                        with one another using named pipes. The clients 
                        communicate with the server hosted on the local device
                        using sockets. The sever handles query requests 
                        from up to 7 clients, directing packets to the 
                        correct destination and dropping those with an invalid
                        destination IP address.

                    <p>
                        Written in Python, this project implements a the reinforcement learning 
                        algorithm SARSA using tile coding and replacing trace to implement a 
                        solution for the mountain car problem. The "car" can not produce enough
                        throttle to escape it's position in between the two mountains. The agent
                        learns that a back and forth motion utilizing momentum and gravity is the 
                        most effective method of escape.
